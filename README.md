# My JavaScript Utilities

This project includes custom implementations of some common JavaScript array methods: filter, map, and reduce. These methods are implemented from scratch to demonstrate their functionality and to serve as a polyfill for environments where these methods are not available.

## Features ✨

- **Custom filter Implementation**: Filters elements of an array based on a provided condition.
- **Custom map Implementation**:  Transforms each element of an array based on a provided function.
- **Custom reduce Implementation**: Reduces an array to a single value based on a provided reducer function and an optional initial value.

## TypeScript Support ✨

This project is written in TypeScript and includes generic types for enhanced type safety and flexibility.
